Astrophysics program simulating the evolution of star systems based on the fast multipole method on adaptive Octrees.

<br>

<b> Multi-physics </b> Octo-Tiger uses a fast-multipole method (FMM) for solving gravity. The implemented FMM globally observes both linear and angular momenta up to machine precision. Coupling the FMM with the hydro solver allows global conversation of energy up to machine precision. For the hydro equation, a finite volume method using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is used.

<b> Parallelism </b> Octotiger used the asynchronous many-task system HPX to schedule lightweight tasks. HPX is the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency. The compute kernels are written in Kokkos to provide support for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
