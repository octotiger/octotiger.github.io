Astrophysics program simulating the evolution of star systems based on the fast multipole method on adaptive Octrees.

<b> Multi-physics </b>   <br>

<b> Applications </b>  <br> Octo-Tiger is particularly suited to modelling interacting binary star systems. Its self consistent field (SCF) code enables the production of initial conditions for
 binaries with barotropic equations of state. The user may set the masses of the components, their Roche lobe filling factors, their separation, and their structural equations of state (which may
 be polytropic, bi-polytropic, or white dwarf). It is possible to produce detached, semi-detached, and contact binaries. These options allows Octo-Tiger to produce approximate initial conditions 
 many binary systems including double white dwarves, main sequence binaries, as well as contact binaries such as V1309 Sco. With initial conditions from the SCF, Octo-Tiger's hydro and gravity modules are 
 used to evolve the system in time. The system is placed in a mesh corotating with the initial orbital frequency of the binary, reducing numerical diffusion. The gravity solver is a fast multipole method (FMM)
 solver which conserves both linear and angular momentum to machine precision, and it is combined with the hydro module in a way that conserves total energy (thermal + kinetic + potential). There are
 on the fly analysis tools which compute quantities such as the masses of each component, their spins and their energies, as well as quantities related to the binary as a whole such as binary separation orbital
 frequency. <br>

<b> Parallelism </b> Octotiger used the asynchronous many-task system HPX to schedule lightweight tasks. HPX is the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency. The compute kernels are written in Kokkos to provide support for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
